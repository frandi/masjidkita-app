description: The open source and networking platform for Masjid
---

MasjidKita is an open source CMS and networking platform for Masjid.

It enables people to set up a digital representation for Masjid easily.
It also helps those Masjids to be connected in a network hub which allows them to share any useful information.

MasjidKita will be available as an open source application which allows everyone to set up an instance of the app on their own infrastructure.
However, MasjidKita will also provide a cloud service for them who don't want to be bothered with technical stuff.
